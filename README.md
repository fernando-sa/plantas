# Plants!
Plants is demo for a plant care marketplace, where you can find people to take care of your plants while you travel or anything else.

# Install
This is a standart Laravel project with MySql server running on docker. To run it simple donwload it and initiate it as common Laravel app. To start database, just run ./startDatabase.sh with docker. In the future I will add gitpod support so you can run it directly in the browser :)

# Why?
Simply so I can practice my back-end skills. All front-end will be done by me but this is mainly to train things like repository patterns, MVC best practices and other stuff.

# Product
My goal is to make the end product usable but not polished, especially in UI/UX since I don't plan to spend a lot of time in this regards.
